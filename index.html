                <strong>Queen is a British rock group created in 1971 which consists of four members. They are one of, 
                if not the most, influencial groups in the twentieth century having produced 15 studio albums and numerous 
                gold and platinum singles. Not only were the four members extremely talented musicians, they each composed 
                the songs that they performed and each of the four members wrote hit singles (which is something no other 
                group can claim). Their legendary performance at the Live Aid concert in 1985 is considered by most to be 
                the greatest live performance in rock history. <br>To watch the video
